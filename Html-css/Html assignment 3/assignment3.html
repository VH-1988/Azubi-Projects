        <p style="color: rgb(10, 10, 240);">
        <b>It was the year <sub>1988</sub> in a small remote village called Lwandlane Location,<br></b>
        <small> where a small energetic baby boy full of <mark>smiles</mark> was born. <br>
        The whole village gathered together to celebrate the birth of new life, <br>
        and as the men and women of this small hard-working village <br>
        in the mountains of Eastern Cape sat around the fire, <br>
        they thought to themselves what are we going to call this boy, <br>
        <q> Ngonyama(lion),</q><br>
        said one villager for he is going to be strong and fierce like a <sup>lion.</sup></small></p>

        Other names came up but there was something about this baby,<br>
        as his smile brought joy and warmed the hearts of the villagers, <br>
        with much thought on what to name him the perfect name was given to him <br>
        and he carried its meaning to this day. <br>
        The name he was given is<strong> Vuyolwethu(our joy).</strong>
